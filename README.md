## Puter Open Source Contribution: Puter-integrated ZetaOffice App
Puter-integrated ZetaOffice App: https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter/issues/1148

ZetaOffice in Puter

It turns out this exists https://zetaoffice.net/demo1.html . This is LibreOffice running in the browser. 
In the demo, the GUI outside of the document canvas is completely built with web technologies, 
while the document canvas itself is LibreOffice. 
This means it's possible to not only integrate LibreOffice with Puter, 
but also to style the UI appropriately and handle actions for saving and 
loading files via Puter's desktop environment.

This likely doesn't require any modifications to Puter internals. 
Start simply by making a regular Puter app. You can check out our app developers page https://developer.puter.com/
